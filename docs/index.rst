Open MPI |ompi_series|
======================

`The Open MPI Project <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ is an open source
implementation of the `Message Passing Interface (MPI) specification
<https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_ that is developed and maintained
by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners.  Open
MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and
resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in
order to build the best MPI library available.  Open MPI offers
advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and
computer science researchers.

Documentation locations
=======================

Documentation for Open can be found in the following locations:

.. list-table::

   * - Open MPI version
     - Documentation location

   * - v5.0.0 and later
     - Open MPI documentation has consolidated and moved to

       https://docs.open-mpi.org/.

   * - v4.1.x and earlier
     - See the `legacy Open MPI FAQ <https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/>`_
       and the README file in the source tarball.

       For example:

This page only exists to emphasize that the Open MPI |ompi_series|
documentation does *not* exist here.  All Open MPI documentation prior
to v5.0.0 exists in the legacy locations listed above.
