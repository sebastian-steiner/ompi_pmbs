Communicator ID. See the mem_tag_format of the provider by running:

[SEP unavailable]

but it is not supported by %s provider. Try disabling this feature.

[SEP ctxt limit]
Reached limit (%d) for number of OFI contexts that can be opened with the

they will re-use existing contexts in round-robin fashion.
Using new communicators beyond the limit will impact performance.
