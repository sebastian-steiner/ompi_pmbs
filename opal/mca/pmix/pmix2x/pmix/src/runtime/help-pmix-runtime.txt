[pmix_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

  %s failed

[missingdata]
PMIx has detected that the host RM failed to provide all the job-level
information specified by the PMIx standard. This is not necessarily
a fatal situation, but may negatively impact your launch performance.

If you feel you have received this warning in error, or wish to ignore
it in the future, you can disable it by setting the PMIx MCA parameter
"pmix_suppress_missing_data_warning=1"
